Brief Discussion on Our Hate Speech Detection Project

Hate speech on social media is a serious issue that affects individuals and communities. The goal of this project is to automate hate speech detection using machine learning techniques and compare thire performances
1. Methodology

    Data Collection: Used a labeled dataset from sources like Twitter.
    Preprocessing: Cleaned text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
    Feature Extraction: Applied TF-IDF to convert text into numerical vectors.
    Model Training: Used Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes to classify text.
    Evaluation: Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. Results

    Random Forest & Logistic Regression performed best, achieving high accuracy.
    Naïve Bayes was faster but had lower accuracy due to word independence assumptions.

3. Conclusion & Future Work

    The project successfully classified hate speech with good accuracy.
    Future improvements include deep learning models (LSTM, BERT), a larger dataset, and better feature extraction techniques.
